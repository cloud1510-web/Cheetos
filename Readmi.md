The project aimed to create a website inspired by the popular snack brand, Cheetos.  Project contains 6 pages: “Home”, “Product”, “Recipes”, “About”, “Where to buy”,  “Other hand”  The primary purpose was to design an engaging and visually appealing platform that reflects the fun and playful essence of the Cheetos brand and providing users with easy access to information about product ranges, prices, and recipes. In “ Where to buy” page, JavaScript is used to make search bar interactive, which means while searching for certain product and clicking “Submit button”,  the searched products background appears to be yellow.
